##################
# 1. What is it? #
##################

eand (Easy Algebraic Numerical Differentiation) is a Python
module implementing numerical differentiation algorithms based on the
algebraic framework initiated in Fliess and Sira-Ramirez 2003 [1].

###############
# 2. Contents #
###############

The current version contains the following sub-packages:

  a. kmand: (Kappa,Mu)-Algebraic Numerical Differentiation
     A one-dimensional derivative estimator working on regularly-spaced
     samples based on Mboup et al. 2009 [2].
     
  b. mddig: MultiDimensional Differentiation on Irregular Grids
     A multidimensional derivative estimator handling irregular sampling
     grids based on Riachy et al. 2011 [3].

###################
# 3. Installation #
###################

Dependencies: numpy, scipy, matplotlib.

##########################
# 4. Future developments #
##########################

Future work will more or less deal with the following issues:
  a. Multi-dimensional numerical differentiation
  b. Fine-tuning of differentiation parameters
