##################
# 1. What is it? #
##################

eand.py (Easy Algebraic Numerical Differentiation for Python) is a
package implementing numerical differentiation algorithms based on the
algebraic framework initiated in Fliess and Sira-Ramirez 2003 [1].

###############
# 2. Contents #
###############

The current version contains the following sub-package:

  a. kmand: a one-dimensional (kappa,mu)-algebraic numerical
     differentiator based on Mboup et al. 2009 [2].

##########################
# 3. Future developments #
##########################

Future work will more or less deal with the following issues:
  a. Multi-dimensional numerical differentiation
  b. Fine-tuning of differentiation parameters
